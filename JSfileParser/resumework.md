## FOR ENG 1 Good Options & Quick summaries:
1. Sign up flow updates: improves user experience, improves data collection, makes sign ups both more comprehensive and simpler. all frontend; angularjs, js, jest,  
2. Text to Speech - dealt with CK canvas, would like to be able to talk more about the tech i got into here but idk what to call it. it was deeply confusing and nest code written years before i got there, with zero documentation. but adding tts vastly improved accessibility for students. should i mention this was a hackathon?
3. Analytics - improved data collection which allowed use to know what was working and what wasnt and make proper choices for improving the product. like, we know which buttons are clicked and which people seem to not know about. javascript, jest, can we use the word "layer" here?
4. Allow/disallow PDF toggle - impact for students and teachers, but was there impact for my team? this ticket involved a scala backend update and even a change to the database schema to save a new attribute for PDF on/off
5. Something from the order page updates -- improve sales / company bottom line, use angularjs. options: add top 3 teachers to order page, add custom quote content on order details, generate order if free trial user doesn't have one, 
6. metrics bars - scss, angular, javascript, was fully responsible for the design as well. allow school admin users to view data which improves things for them and incentivizes them buying and/or keeping pro
7. select peers dialog - allows users to refer others for pro accounts. more exposure to our product === more sales, and teachers are happy because they get some free pro features. 


## FOR JR:
1. work done in ruby scripts for internal tooling
2. work done in react for internal tooling
3. bug hunting stuff? js/angularjs
4. backlog grooming?
is this what we want though? this is so specific, i feel like lucy's were more broad?
