# Interview Stuff From Amelie

lots of interviews using coderpad (paid)

## detect fraud 
-> list of transactions with a location, dollar amount, and ID, must determine if it is fraud by checking if there are three transactions in a row which have the same dollar amount and location.
const transactions = [“1, loc1, 200”, “2, loc2, 200”, etc..]

## to-do list 
-> uses mustache, a templating language. must create scripts which essentially send data from your JS to your HTML. basically debug this: https://codepen.io/smd5/pen/wvvZjaY

## other one 
-> [2,3, “+”, 5, “*”] given this array, return the result such that, two and three should be added, and then turn into 5, and then 5 and 5 should be multiplied. sort of like an order of operations. the result here would be 25.
