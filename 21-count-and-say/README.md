# Count and Say

Given an integer *n* where 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, generate the *nth* term of the "count-and-say" sequence, found below. You can do so recursively, in other words from the previous member read off the digits, counting the number of digits in groups of the same digit.

The count-and-say sequence: 
1. 1
2. 11
3. 21
4. 1211
5. 111221

A longer description that actually makes sense from [SirKris](https://leetcode.com/sirkris/):

You start with "1" as the first line.

Each subsequent line (n) is generated by passing the line before it (n - 1) as an input to a somewhat unusual function (I'll explain as brute-force for illustrative purposes):

Loop through the line (n - 1) as a string. For a given character, count how many consecutive times it repeats, then put that on line n followed by the number.

For example:

If you have "1", the next line is "11".
If you have "11", the next line is "21".
If you have "111", the next line is "31".
If you have "1111", the next line is "41".
See the basic pattern? Just do that for every set of repeating characters on the previous line.
Here's what it looks like with more than one sequence:

If you have "11222", the next line is "2132" ("11" becomes "21" and "222" becomes "32").
If you have "112225", the next line is "213215" ("11" becomes "21", "222" becomes "32", and "5" becomes "15").
In terms of the sequence dictated by the description, here's the first 15 lines of output:

- "1"
- "11"
- "21"
- "1211"
- "111221"
- "312211"
- "13112221"
- "1113213211"
- "31131211131221"
- "13211311123113112211"
- "11131221133112132113212221"
- "3113112221232112111312211312113211"
- "1321132132111213122112311311222113111221131221"
- "11131221131211131231121113112221121321132132211331222113112211"
- "311311222113111231131112132112311321322112111312211312111322212311322113212221"

## Examples

```javascript
    countAndSay(1)
        => "1"
    countAndSay(4)
        => "1211"
```

## Constraints
- Each term of the sequence of integers should be represented as a string.
