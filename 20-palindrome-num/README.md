# Palindrome Number

Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

## Examples

```javascript
    isPalindrome(121)
        => true
    isPalindrome(221)
        => false
    isPalindrome(-121)
        => false
```

For the third example above, -121 read backwards would be 121-, and does not therefore qualify as a palindrome.
