# Make an Octothorpe Staircase

Given an integer, make a "staircase" of octothorpes. Observe staircase of size `n=4`:

```javascript
   #
  ##
 ###
####
```

The base and the height are each equal to `n`. The staircase is right-aligned. The last line is not preceded by any symbols. 

## Examples

```javascript
    staircase(4)
        => 
           #
          ##
         ###
        ####
    staircase(6)
        => 
             #
            ##
           ###
          ####
         #####
        ######
```

## Constraints
- `N` will always be a single integer, no less than 1 and no greater than 100.
