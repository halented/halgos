# Find Intersection of Arrays

- Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection. 

## Examples

```javascript
    intersect([1,2,2,1],[2,2])
        => [2,2]
    intersect([4,9,5],[9,4,9,8,4])
        => [4,9]
```

## Constraints
- Each element in the result should appear as many times as it shows in both arrays.
- The result can be in any order.
